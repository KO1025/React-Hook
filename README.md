# React-hooks
Goal is make to build the most simple and raw explanations about react hooks with real life use cases. Where you edit the code and run within my web page while learning.


1. **Install Modules.**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start project locally.**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
